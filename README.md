# battle-pass (with InfluxDB 2.x stats)
The best battle pass plugin on Spigot

## Why open source?

For the normal BattlePass, see Spigot here https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/63076/ or the GitHub page here https://github.com/titanlabs-mc/battle-pass. This version simply adds on to BattlePass InfluxDB logging for stats. It's not that useful, more meant as practice and it was easier to fork it.

## What is InfluxDB?

Google it. If you don't know what it is, IDK why you're here anyway sooooooo.... Love you anyway. Stock BattlePass is here https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/63076/.
