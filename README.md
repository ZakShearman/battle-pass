# battle-pass (with InfluxDB 2.x stats)
The best battle pass plugin on Spigot

## Should I be here? What does this do?

For the normal BattlePass, see Spigot here https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/63076/ or the GitHub page here https://github.com/titanlabs-mc/battle-pass. This version simply adds on to BattlePass InfluxDB logging for stats. It's not that useful, more meant as practice and it was easier to fork it.

Just to say, this is a really simple and efficient modification. All data sending is done async so there is near to no performance impact. This is the impact on a timings report when sending 12k - 30k data points every 30 seconds.
