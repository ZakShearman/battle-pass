# Contribution requirements

## Contributing to source

To make any codebase changes, you must have signed our CLA found here https://titanlabs.dev/cla.<br/>
You are expected to follow good coding practices, specifically Google's Java style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html.<br/>
Do not add massively bloated or unnecessary features, they need to have a purpose (e.g influxdb support is left as a fork and not merged).
